# **IDCamp 2024: Machine Learning Project Submission**  

## **Overview**  
This repository showcases my submission for the **Machine Learning Engineer for Beginner** learning path. The project involves:  
- **Clustering**: Using K-Means to segment data into meaningful clusters.  
- **Classification**: Building predictive models with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.  

## **Features**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the dataset and feature importance.  
- **Clustering**: Grouping data based on patterns using K-Means.  
- **Classification Models**: Comparative performance of multiple algorithms.  

## **Results**  
- Achieved **perfect accuracy** across all models, highlighting the strong patterns in the dataset.  

## **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alrescha79-cmd/ML-clustering-classsification
   ```  
2. Install required dependencies.  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks for clustering and classification.
